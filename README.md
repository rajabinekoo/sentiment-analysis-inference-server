# Yelp Reviews Sentiment Analysis - Backend

**This FastAPI project serves an interface for a backend sentiment analysis system built using Apache Spark and Scala (see: https://github.com/rajabinekoo/sentiment-analysis-ml-spark-scala).**

## Overview

Provide a more detailed overview of your project. Explain its architecture, key components, and any important design decisions.

## Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up your project.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.7+
    * pip (Python package installer)

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd [project_directory]
    ```

3.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file with all the necessary dependencies, including `fastapi` and `uvicorn`)*

## Usage

Explain how to run and use your FastAPI application. Provide code examples where necessary.

1.  **Run the application using Uvicorn:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    *(Replace `main` with the name of your main Python file and `app` with the name of your FastAPI application instance.)*

2.  **Access the API:**
    Once the application is running, you can access the API endpoints in your web browser or using tools like `curl` or Postman. For example:

    * **Root endpoint:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
    * **API documentation (Swagger UI):** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
    * **API documentation (Redoc):** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`

## Configuration

If your application requires any configuration, explain how to set it up (e.g., environment variables, configuration files).
